/**
 * Correlations are a measure of the relationship between two variables (see https://developer.exist.io/reference/object_types/).
 *
 * A positive correlation implies that as one variable increases (its values get higher), so does the other. A negative correlation implies that as one variable increases, the other decreases. We present these to users as a way to explain past trends, and use them to predict future behaviour.
 *
 * Correlation values vary between -1 and +1 with 0 implying no correlation. Correlations of -1 or +1 imply an exact linear relationship.
 *
 * P-values are a way of determining confidence in the result. A value lower than 0.05 is generally considered "statistically significant". We provide a user-friendly stars integer which maps to the P-value, where 5 stars indicates a value well below 0.05.
 *
 * We create simple English sentences to represent each possible correlation as a combination of attributes.
 *
 * We're also careful to represent these as correlations only, not as one attribute directly causing a change in the other, and we ask that you do the same. Correlation is not causation. There may be many hidden factors which underlie the relationship between two attributes. It is up to the user to determine the cause.
 *
 * Correlations are generated weekly on Sundays.
